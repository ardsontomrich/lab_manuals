The following important rules serve to keep facts separate
from opinions and reduce the chances of getting a garbled copy of the data:

(1) Take your raw data in pen, directly into your lab
notebook. This is what real scientists do. The point is
to make sure that what you're writing down is a first-hand
record, without mistakes introduced by recopying it.
(If you don't have your two lab notebooks yet,
staple today's raw data into your notebook when you get it.)

(2) Everybody should record their own copy of the raw data.
Do not depend on a ``group secretary.''

(3) If you do calculations during lab, keep them on a
separate page or draw a line down the page and keep
calculations on one side of the line and raw data on the
other. This is to distinguish facts from inferences.
(I will deduct 25\% from your grade if you mix calculations and raw data.)

(4) Never write numbers without units. Without units, a number is
meaningless. There is a big difference bewteen ``Johnny is six''
and ``Johnny is six feet.'' 
(I will deduct 25\% from your grade if you write numbers without units.)

Because this is the first meeting of the lab class, there is
no prelab writeup due at the beginning of the class. 
Instead, you will discuss your results with your instructor
at various points.
