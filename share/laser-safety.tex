Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Before beginning a lab using lasers, make sure you
understand these points, initial them, and show your safety
checklist to your instructor. If you don't understand
something, ask your instructor for clarification.

\_\_\_\_\_ The laser can damage your eyesight permanently if the
beam goes in your eye.

\_\_\_\_\_ When you're not using the laser, turn it off
 or put something in front of it.

\_\_\_\_\_ Keep it below eye level and keep the beam horizontal.
Don't bend or squat so that your eye is near the level of the beam.

\_\_\_\_\_ Keep the beam confined to your own lab bench. Whenever
possible, orient your setup so that the beam is going toward the
wall. If the beam is going to go off of your lab bench, use a backpack
or a box to block the beam.

\_\_\_\_\_ Don't let the beam hit shiny surfaces such as faucets, because
unpredictable reflections can result.
