Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_ Never work with high voltages by yourself.

\_\_\_\_\_ Do not leave HV wires exposed - make sure
there is insulation.

\_\_\_\_\_ Turn the high-voltage supply off while working on the circuit.

\_\_\_\_\_ When the voltage is on, avoid using both hands at
once to touch the apparatus. Keep one hand in your pocket
while using the other to touch the apparatus. That way, it
is unlikely that you will get a shock across your chest. 

\_\_\_\_\_ It is possible for an electric current to cause
your hand to clench involuntarily. If you observe this
happening to your partner, do not try to pry their hand
away, because you could become incapacitated as well ---
simply turn off the switch or pull the plug out of the wall.
